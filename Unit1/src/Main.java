//If the terminal/console is not in the screenshot, it will not have worked as it will be considered wrong.

//There should be a while loop asking players to either continue playing or stop playing after each round (y/n answer)
//Player input can either be a string or integer to select rack/paper/scissors.
//A tally of wins should be kept, and after the player chooses to end the game, the tally should print out for both players.
